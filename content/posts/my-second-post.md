## Introduction

Updating documents and managing their versions are crucial aspects of maintaining a Hugo website stored in a GitHub repository. This guide provides a step-by-step process for uploading a document with the same name, including a new commit message, and accessing previous versions of the document on GitHub.

## Uploading a Document with the Same Name

To update a document on your Hugo site's GitHub repository:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Open your web browser and go to the GitHub page of your Hugo website's repository.
2. **Find the Document**: Browse the repository's directories to locate the document you wish to update.
3. **Upload the Updated Document**:
   - Click on the "Add file" button near the top right of the page and select "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your updated document file or click "choose your files" to browse for the document on your computer. Ensure the document's name matches the one you're replacing.
4. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Below the file list, find the "Commit changes" box.
   - Enter a commit message that describes the update. For instance, "Update project documentation with latest figures."
   - Choose whether to commit directly to the current branch or to create a new branch and open a pull request.
   - Click "Commit changes".

## Viewing and Accessing Previous Versions

GitHub keeps track of all changes, allowing you to access previous versions of your documents.

1. **View the Commit History**:
   - In your repository, click on the "Commits" link near the top to see the list of changes.
2. **Find the Previous Version**:
   - Look through the commit history to find the commit made before your most recent update.
   - Click on the commit to view the changes or the state of the repository at that time.
3. **Access the Previous Document**:
   - In the commit view, click on the filename to view the document as it was before your latest update.
   - You can now view or download the previous version of the document.

## Restoring a Previous Version

If you need to revert to a previous version of a document:

1. **Checkout to the Desired Commit**:
   - Using Git command line tools, you can checkout to the commit that precedes your recent changes.
   - Run `git checkout <commit-hash>` where `<commit-hash>` is the identifier of the commit you wish to revert to.
2. **Update Your Hugo Site Accordingly**:
   - Make any necessary adjustments to your Hugo site to accommodate the reverted document.
   - Commit the changes to make the revert permanent.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage document updates and versioning for your Hugo site on GitHub. This ensures that your site remains up-to-date, while also preserving the integrity and history of your documents.
